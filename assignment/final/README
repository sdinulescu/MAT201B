MAT201B Final Project
Stejara Dinulescu
*********************

1. This project is built in C++ using AlloLib by the Allosphere Research Group. To run the project, you must have AlloLib downloaded from GitHub. I am using VS Code to modify files and run the project.
2. My final project is found in my MAT201B GitHub repository (https://github.com/sdinulescu/MAT201B) under assignment/final. To run the program, you must in the allolib_playground directory. From there, use ./run.sh [yourDirectory]/assignment/final/final.cpp.
3. Structure of the program:
	- "final.cpp" is the main file. This is what needs to be run from the terminal.
	- "agent.cpp": supporting file describing an agent
		- ImpulseGenerator -> written by Aaron Anderson, taken from Pedal (a pedagogical audio library) by Aaron Anderson and Keehong Youn
		- Chirplet -> describes an agent sound (in form of a chirplet)
		- Agent -> describes an agent
		- DrawableAgent -> what is given to the renderers
	- "field.cpp": supporting file describing the environmental field
		- Food -> food particles consumed by the agent
		- Forces -> fluid simulation
	- "state.cpp": supporting file describing the Shared State. This describes what is given to the renderers when run in the AlloSphere or when run in multiple windows simulating runtime in the AlloSphere.
4. Final Project Report is found in the pdf titled MAT201B_StejaraDinulescu_FinalProjectReport.pdf.
5. Supporting screenshots are included (found in my report, see point number 4)
